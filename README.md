# Web Privacy and Cookie Consent Banner Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and analysis tools for a master's thesis project focused on web privacy, specifically analyzing cookie consent banners and the effectiveness of various browser extensions and privacy tools.

## Project Description

This research project investigates the impact of different browser extensions and privacy tools on web tracking and cookie consent mechanisms. The study analyzes how various privacy-enhancing technologies affect the behavior of websites, particularly focusing on:

- **Cookie Consent Banners**: Analysis of how different privacy tools interact with cookie consent mechanisms
- **Browser Extensions**: Evaluation of popular privacy extensions like uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, Ghostery, and others
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Examination of HTTP vs HTTPS protocol usage and third-party tracking
- **Data Collection Patterns**: Understanding how websites adapt their tracking strategies based on privacy tools

## Key Features

### üï∑Ô∏è Automated Web Crawling
- **Parallel Crawling**: Multi-profile browser automation for efficient data collection
- **Profile Management**: Support for 18+ different browser profiles with various privacy extensions
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automated capture of cookie consent banners and page states
- **Network Traffic Recording**: Comprehensive logging of all network requests and responses

### üìä Analysis Tools
- **Protocol Analysis**: HTTP vs HTTPS usage analysis across different privacy tools
- **Banner Detection**: Automated identification and classification of cookie consent banners
- **Storage Analysis**: Examination of cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage usage
- **Source Identification**: Tracking of third-party domains and their purposes
- **Cookie Classification**: Categorization of cookies by function and privacy impact

### üîß Privacy Extensions Tested
- **Ad Blockers**: uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus, AdGuard
- **Privacy Tools**: Privacy Badger, Disconnect, Ghostery
- **Cookie Managers**: Consent-O-Matic, I Don't Care About Cookies, Cookie Cutter
- **Consent Automation**: Super Agent, Accept All Cookies
