# Web Privacy and Cookie Consent Banner Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and analysis tools for a master's thesis project focused on web privacy, specifically analyzing cookie consent banners and the effectiveness of various browser extensions and privacy tools.

## Project Description

This research project investigates the impact of different browser extensions and privacy tools on web tracking and cookie consent mechanisms. The study analyzes how various privacy-enhancing technologies affect the behavior of websites, particularly focusing on:

- **Cookie Consent Banners**: Analysis of how different privacy tools interact with cookie consent mechanisms
- **Browser Extensions**: Evaluation of popular privacy extensions like uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, Ghostery, and others
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Examination of HTTP vs HTTPS protocol usage and third-party tracking
- **Data Collection Patterns**: Understanding how websites adapt their tracking strategies based on privacy tools
